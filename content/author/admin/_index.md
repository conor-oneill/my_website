I'm an Australian data scientist currently operating remotely from India.

I've worked with groups from large multinationals to startups to small internal teams. I help stakeholders understand how they can use data to help solve problems they are facing, design solutions that meet their needs, and execute those solutions.

In a past life I was an astrophysics and cosmology researcher, and am still involved in the field on the side.
